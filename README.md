This plugin let you import posts and pages from others platforms to a Spress site.

**Note**: this plugin is in a early stage. That means that its behaviour could change
frecuenly without notice until it reaches a stable version.

## Source permalinks
Import plugin tries to preserve the source permalink of each item. To reach that
goal, this plugin adds the attributes: `permalink` and `no_html_extension`.

e.g: for an item with the following permalink at source: `http://acme.com/what-is-new-this-time`
the front matter block generated will be:

```yaml
---
permalink: '/what-is-new-this-time'
no_html_extension: true
---
```

[--terms_delimiter_character TERMS-DELIMITER-CHARACTER] [--] <file>
